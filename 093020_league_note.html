    <p>Though no records were broken, this week continued the high scoring throughout our fantasy league. The average score was 114. Someone tell one of the Eagles‚Äô 8 offensive coordinators that offensive production is up around the league. </p>
    <p>Naturally, we‚Äôll start with the lowest scoring game: The Ed Horne Football Team had all 6 skill players underperform their projects in a 100.0 ‚Äì 81.46 loss to Team America.  Bubba was carried by a red-hot Russell Wilson, who scored 46.8 of their 100 points. Team America is now 3-0 but could benefit from shopping bench player Aaron Rodgers to improve their other positions.  The Crackers reverted to the mean after last week, losing 112.6 ‚Äì 96.38 to Waiver Wire. Cracker‚Äôs RB James Robinson (WHO?) scored 27.9 from the bench.  Waiver Wire, heavy at WR, managed the win with both Michael Thomas and AJ Brown out.  </p>
    <p>The Hulkamaniacs and the Street Fighters played the closest game of the week, and the Street Fighters fell 123.02 ‚Äì 116.6.  The Hulkamaniacs were led by their Saints, Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara.  The Street Fighters had two top scorers, with Patrick Mahomes (48!) and Austin Ekeler (25.8), but most of the team was trash üóëÔ∏è.  Team Uncle Bill blew out the Afternoon Delights 140.68 ‚Äì 88.38.  The Delights had plenty of underperformers contribute to their loss. The Colts D/ST led the way for Team Uncle Bill with 2 pick sixes against the Jets, but 140.68 was only good for the 3rd highest score of the week. </p>

    <p>The Crusaders and Bareback Barback, two winless teams coming in, battled to a 140.1 ‚Äì 123.38 victory for the Crusaders.  The Crusader‚Äôs RBs had their best week, but 1st round pick Julio Jones is still out.  Barback was led by Tom Brady at 29.88.  Barback had the highest score of a losing team, which should make his 0-3 loser team feel better. The Crusaders would have had the highest score of the week, if not for a Sunday morning lineup change which swapped Michael Gallup for Corey Davis.  Instead, Hall wins the weekly prize in a 146.04 ‚Äì 99.28 defeat of Farmer Fran.  Hall had strong performances from his WRs and the trendy QB of the week, Josh Allen. Defending champion Farmer Fran can‚Äôt be feeling good about defending his title with this 1-2 start. Hopefully, it starts affecting his golf game.  And just like his favorite professional golfer, Fran claims he will only accept the results of this season if he wins (Spoiler: He won‚Äôt). </p>

    <h3>Steelers-Titans Postponed</h3>
    <p>As explained in the texts, if the Titans-Steelers game is played by Wednesday, as expected, it will count for this upcoming week. However, if the game is postponed beyond this week after other games have been played (and lineups locked), the Emergency Substitutions would come into play. </p>
    <center><a href="images/emergency.JPG"><img class="img" src="images/emergency.JPG" /></a></center>
    <p>As an example, we‚Äôll use Farmer Fran‚Äôs lineup. Say the game is eventually scheduled to be played on Tuesday night, but on Tuesday morning the game is postponed to a much later date due to additional positive results. Typically, Fran would be stuck with JuJu Smith-Schuster‚Äôs score of 0 because everyone else has been locked in. But, with this rule, Fran can belatedly substitute a predetermined player in, based on projected scores. Because starter Cooper Kupp could fill the WR spot, the highest projected FLEX player will be used. In this case, Allen Lazard would be used. At that point, the actual scores will be known, but they‚Äôre irrelevant to the selection. Phillip Lindsay could have scored 69 points on Thursday and Mantione could plead that he would have started Lindsay over Lazard because he thinks Lindsay is hotter, but the only allowed player is Lazard. </p>

    <center><a href="images/fran_emergency.JPG"><img class="img" src="images/fran_emergency.JPG" /></a></center>

    <p>The idea is to both avoid a situation where Mantione is screwed by the game being postponed and not give him a competitive advantage. Using the highest projected player allows for the substitution that a reasonable person would have made without knowledge of how the games played out and doesn‚Äôt require having everyone set a bunch of provisional lineups. </p>

    <h3>Around the NFL</h3>
    <p>A happy ending in Florida: Robert Kraft stood erect and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/21/robert-kraft-likely-to-get-off-in-florida-massage-parlor-case/">beat off</a> the solicitation charges against him. Billionaires have been mishandled by the system for far too long, and it‚Äôs about time one of them was able to get off. </p>

    <p>Odell Beckham looks like he could be an excellent defensive back.  On a would-be Baker Mayfield interception, Beckham made a great pass deflection play and followed it up with a flawless finger wag. The finger wag is usually reserved for corners who get beat and then bailed out by a QB making a bad throw, but it translates well to a WR actually making a good defensive play after his QB makes a bad throw. </p>
