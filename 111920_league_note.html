        The Afternoon Delights win the high score prize for the second time. They also lead in the pool to win all the 
        Tommy fines with a 100 point lead over the next closest team in <i>Points Against</i>.  $20 will be added to that pot
        thanks to a David Johnson move to IR (Hulkamanaics - 2nd fine) and another namesake infraction (his second).  Tommy has left George Kittle
        starting for two weeks in a row, after being placed on IR back on November 5. The Afternoon Delights are eagerly waiting
        to see if he starts again this week for Barback.  No one has won the Bad Beat in a while.  It's up to $105 for the final
        week. If it's not hit the money goes back into the Winner/Runner-up pool.
    </p>  
    <p>
        Week 11 could be a wild week for some teams vying for the playoffs. Team Uncle bill has clinched the #1 seed by virtue
        of a 2 game lead over the next best team. The Crusaders have opted to take themselves out of the running for the 
        playoffs to give other teams a chance. The Crusaders are likely to finish the season with the 2nd most points scored. There are 
        3 available playoff slots for 5 teams. Hall, the Crackers, and the Ed Horne Football team are in a dead heat. Waiver Wire
        has a leg up on the competition, and Team America is right there, but has a big tiebreaker disadvantage.  These are the 
        playoff scenarios from the perspective of each team:
    </p>
    <h3>Waiver Wire</h3>
    <p>
        It would take an act of God for Waiver Wire to miss the playoffs. For that to happen,
        <ul>
            <li>Hall would need to beat Wire by at least 14.72 <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Crackers vs Ed Horne Football: If the Crackers win, they'd need to outscore Wire by 28.44; If 
                EFT wins, they'd need to outscore Wire by 32.1 <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Team America would need to beat Team Uncle Bill and outscore Wire by 101.12</li>
        </ul> 
        This occured in 17 out of 100,000 simulations by the forecaster, or a 0.017% chance.
    </p>
    <h3>Team America</h3>
    <p>
        They almost need to beat the 1st place Uncle Bill to have a chance this week. 
        If they lose, they'd need:
        <ul>
            <li>A Hall Loss <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Outscore both Hall and the loser of Crackers vs EFT by 70+ points (in a loss themselves)</li>
        </ul>
        That's extremely unlikely, but not completely impossible. With a win Team America would only need:
        <ul>
            <li>A Hall loss <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>A Hall win <b>AND</b> Team America would need to make up 70+ points on one of three teams: Hall, Waiver Wire,
            or the winner of EFT vs Crackers.</li>
        </ul> 
        By far the easiest path is a Team America win and a Hall loss.        
    </p>
    <h3>Hall</h3>
    <p>
        A win almost assures a playoff berth. With a win they only need:
        <ul>
            <li>Win by 14.72 over Waiver Wire <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>A Team America loss <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>Waiver Wire to lose by less than 14.72 <b>AND</b> a Team America win <b>AND</b>
                Team America to outscore them by 86.4 <b>AND</b> the winner of Crackers/EFT to outscore them by 13.72 or 17.38</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If Hall loses, they'd need:
        <ul>
            <li>A Team America loss <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>To <b>NOT</b> be outscored by 86.4 by Team America <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>To <b>NOT</b> be outscored by 13.72 by a losing Crackers team or 17.38 by a losing Ed Horne Football Team</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Crackers</h3>
    <p>
        Nearly a play-in game. The only scenario where they win and <b>MISS</b> the playoffs is
        <ul>
            <li>Hall wins <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Team America wins <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Team America outscores the Crackers by 72.68 <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>The Crackers <b>DO NOT</b> outscore either Hall by 13.72 or Waiver Wire by 28.44.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the Crackers lose, then the only way they make the playoffs is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hall loses <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>Crackers outscore Hall by 13.72 <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>Team America loses <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>Team America does not outscore the Crackers by 72.68</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Ed Horne Football Team</h3>
    <p>
        Nearly a play-in game. The only scenario where they win and <b>MISS</b> the playoffs is
        <ul>
            <li>Hall wins <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Team America wins <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>Team America outscores EFT by 69.02 <b>AND</b></li>
            <li>EFT <b>DOES NOT</b> outscore either Hall by 17.38 or Waiver Wire by 32.1.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If EFT loses, then the only way they make the playoffs is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hall loses <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>EFT outscores Hall by 17.38 <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>Team America loses <b>AND</b></li>
        <li>Team America does not outscore EFT by 69.02</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Waiver Wire is in great shape. Hall, the Crackers, and Ed Horne Football Team are in great shape if they win.
        Hall has a chance if he loses. The Crackers and Ed Horne need a lot of help if they lose.  Team America needs a win and some help 
        or a loss and a miracle. These scenarios can also be seen below in a chart made by Hall.

    <h3>COVID Executive Order Emergency Amendment</h3>
    <p>
        In the event that the commisioner either dies of COVID, or dies immediately after winning a <i>Gladiator</i>-style tournament: the Crusaders players are to be freed. The monSTARS are to be reinstated.
        There once was a dream that was this league; it shall be realized.  These are the wishes of Paul Walker.  Bareback Bareback
        is still on thin ice, though, especially if George Kittle starts again this week.
