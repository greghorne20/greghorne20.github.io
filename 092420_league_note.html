        The Crackers, the all-time winningest team, have set a new record high score with their 161.42 win over the Afternoon Delights in Week 2. The Delights held the previous high score, at 160.08, from a 2015 Week 3 win over the Hulkamaniacs.
        The Crackers were led by Aaron Jones with 3-TD and 200+ yards. Matty "Ice" Ryan was also good in an embarassing loss to the Dallas Cowboys.
        Team Uncle Bill had an impressive week, taking down the Crusaders 156.9-122.54.  Team Uncle Bill's score is the 6th most of all time.  Dak Prescott, known for his garbage time stat padding, accidentally fell into a comeback win when the 
        Falcons onsides recovery team gave the game away.  The Crusaders managed to be the 3rd highest scoring team this week in their loss, which puts them at 0-2. Since there's no Bad Beat winner this week, the prize pool increases to $30.
    </p>  

    <p>
        Team America took down the Hulkamaniacs, winning by 10. Team America has both Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson rostered, respectively the 6th and 1st highest scoring QBs so far this year. Alvin Kamara's 2-TD, 174 yard game wasn't enough for 
        the Hulkamaniacs.  Hall easily beat the Street Fighters, but lost his first round pick, Saquon Barkley, in the process.  Chris Carson is a strong second option at RB, but the injury will likely push Brandin Cooks into a starting FLEX position
        for Hall.  The Street Fighters started two players who ended their games with big, fat ZEROs! Though active, Will Fuller the fif was not targeted at all. In Tampa, Gronk is struggling to reconnect with his former lover, Tom Brady.  Gronk was targeted 
        just once, on a throw that resulted in an interception.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Ed Horne Football Team recorded their first win as a franchise by beating The Bareback Barback 122.4-107.08.  Tommy's all-time record sits at 71-87, good for worst winning percentage of an active team (RamRod and Fuzzman are worse).
        EHFT was led by Tyler Higbee's 3 TDs on the Eagles "defense". Tommy got only 10 points from his QB postion. Farmer Fran managed a win with only 93.56, thanks to Waiver Wire's abysmal 64.58 score.  Christian McCaffrey led the way for Fran, but
        will miss several weeks with an injury. Wire may need to hit the waivers to find a new QB if Carson Wentz doesn't improve. Greg Olsen, who put up a ZERO on one target, is also struggling, though he scored 10.4 in week 1.

      <h3 class="w3-center">Eagles suprised to learn last two games weren't the preseason</h3>
      <p>The Eagles sucked on offense and defense last week. They'll need to improve in both areas to be a contender this year.  Fortunately, they play the Bengals this week, a team much better at sucking than the Eagles. 
          Though the Bengals have sucked for over a decade, the Eagles have not beaten the Bengals since 2000!  Bill Clinton was still getting blown in the oval office back then!</p>

                December 4, 2016 - Wentz and Doug's rookie season. The Eagles go down 29-0 before finally scoring on a Zach Ertz
                reception in the 3rd quarter. Final: 32-14.
            </li>
            <li>
                December 13, 2012 - Andy's last year. The Eagles were bad and lost 34-13. The only TD came on a Nick Foles pass to Riley
                Cooper.
            </li>
            <li>
                November 16, 2008 - Donovan was terrible. He threw 3 picks and lost a fumble. After the game, he admitted that he didn't
                know NFL games could end in ties. This one did, 13-13. The next week, he would be benched at halftime with a statline of
                8/18, 59 yards, 2 INT, and 1 fumble lost against the Ravens. However, Donovan got his starting job back the following
                week and turned the season around, thanks to some drunken encouragement coming from a club box, in a 48-20 Thanksgiving
                win
                over the eventual NFC Champion Cardinals.
            </li>
            <li>
                January 2, 2005 - The Eagles had already locked up the #1 seed. Koy Detmer and Jeff Blake played QB for the Eagles this
                game.
            </li>

        <p>
            During the Eagles-Rams game, FOX showed some old footage. The Ed Horne Football Team's GM noted that a former Packers QB looks an awful lot like current Eagles Head Coach Doug Pederson.
            The resemblence is uncanny.
