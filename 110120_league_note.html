        Team Uncle Bill is the 7th unique team to win the weekly high points prize. Uncle Bill took down Farmer Fran, which puts Uncle Bill in great playoff position
        and reigning champion Farmer Fran on the brink of elimination.  The Crackers were upset by the 3-4 Hulkamaniacs. The Crackers are still in good position, but a win would 
        have really solidifed their playoff odds. The Hulkamaniacs managed to keep a sliver of playoff hope alive, but with only 4 teams making the playoffs this year, 7 teams with a better record, and a major
        disadvantage in the points tiebreaker, their chances are slim. The Crusaders survived in an important game against the Delights thanks in part to Kyler Murray's great game on MNF. Murray is averaging 
        31.7 points, best overall at QB. The Delights, at 1-6, now have a 0.001% chance of making the playoffs according to the forecast.  The forecaster simulates the season 100,000 times. The Delights got the 4th spot 
        in one of those simulated seasons.

        Barksdale's Waiver Wire beat the Ed Horne Football Team in a big game between two playoff hopefuls. Waiver Wire needs Wentz to continue his hot streak and would really benefit by a Michael Thomas return.
        The Ed Horne Football Team managed the highest score by a losing team this week with only 7 active starters (Tommy fine). Tyler Higbee was a Monday night gametime decision, but was declared out. In another 
        game between playoff contenders, Hall took down Team America. Hall was the lowest scoring winner of the week, but now sits at 5-2 in second place. Team America still has a half-decent shot at a playoff run 
        thanks to their strong start, but they are very low in the points scored tiebreaker. To put the 11.9% playoff chance given by the forecast in perspective: Joe Blanton had a 10.6% chance of getting a hit in
        any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoCA4l3kLzM&ab_channel=MLB">random At-Bat.</a>  In the most inconsequential game of the week, Bareback Barback blew out the Street Fighters. Bareback is actually
        4th in the league in points scored, but their 2-5 record makes it near impossible to make the playoffs. The Street Fighters may or may not be mathematically eliminated, but they made the playoffs in 0 of 100,000 
        simulations by the forecaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upcoming week (meaning the week of games that started 3 days ago) has a few games with big playoff implications. The Crusaders and Waiver Wire, both basically coin flips to make the playoffs, face off. The Crackers
      and Team Uncle Bill play, the former looking to stay on the inside of the playoff bubble, the latter looking to secure the 1st seed. The Ed Horne Football Team needs a win against Hall as the season begins to wind down, whereas Hall is eyeing 
      a top playoff seed.  Team America is in the fortunate position of playing the Street Fighters, but the game is currently projected to be close.
