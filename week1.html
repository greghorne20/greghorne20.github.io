  <p></p>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <p>The draft was a major success. Each team managed to draft 14 players, some of them were even good picks,
      and there were no reported fatalities.</p>
    <h4>Awards</h4>
    <p>
      <b>High Character Team:</b> <i>Afternoon Delights</i> - The Delights led with Tyreek Hill,
      who is also an amateur fighter. He successfully <a href="https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/08/21/tyreek-hill-oklahoma-state-football-domestic-violence-battery-plea-agreement">
      defeated his pregnant girlfriend</a> back in 2014, before more
      recently moving on to the men's division, where he handedly <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/3/15/18267956/police-hill-police-report-son-battery-investigation">
      beat his 3 year old son</a>. In the second round,
      the Delights chose Antonio Brown, a misunderstood man who is stuck in a system that is set up to make him fail.
      If Antonio were born in a different era, he would be able to showcase his talents to the world and would enjoy
      a much better life.  Darrius Guice's brother was a <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2014/03/eagles_desean_jackson_off-the-field_troubles.html">
      drive-by shooting driver</a>. Christian Kirk was charged with disorderly conduct after <a="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2018/05/14/arizona-cardinals-christian-kirk-arrested-charged-disorderly-conduct-phoenix-open/609474002/">
      throwing rocks at cars</a>. Desean Jackson was once <a href="https://www.nj.com/eagles/2014/03/eagles_desean_jackson_off-the-field_troubles.html" >
      accused of gang activity</a> by "sports journalist" Eliot Shorr-Parks in a story that was co-authored by Chip Kelly.
    </p>
    <p><b>2020 Best Keeper Prediction:</b> <i>Austin Ekeler (Rd 8) by Hall</i> - Ekeler could have a breakout year, especially if Gordon is traded.</p>
    <p><b>First Kicker Award</b>: <i>Harrison Butker (Rd 8) by Bubba</i> - This led to an early run on kickers.  Pat, Tommy, Ryan, and Uncle Bill all took kickers
      in the next 2 rounds while everyone else continued to take players at unimportant positions like RB, QB, WR and TE.
    </p>
    <p><b>Most Un-Woke Pick:</b> <i>Drew Brees (Chris)</i> - Brees recently <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/06/lgbt-activists-drew-brees-promoting-bible-homophobic/">
      declared war</a> on the entire LGBTTQQIAAP (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual)

  <h2 class="w3-center">Checking in on Chip</h2>
  <p></p>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <p>
      Chip Kelly and UCLA Bruins have just embarked on their second season together.
      Chip added a new wrinkle to his offense this year. Now, half of the offense goes in motion before
      the snap.  This appears to be an attempt to wear out his players even more, so they're completely exhausted by
      the 4th quarter. Video below.

  <h2 class="w3-center">Eli Manning Hall Of Fame Candidacy Update</h2>
  <p></p>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <h4>Case for Eli Manning getting into the Hall of Fame</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Eli Manning was the starting quarterback for 2 super bowl winning teams</li>
      <li>Eli has been very healthy over his career, starting every game from mid-2004 to his 2017 benching, so he has piled up impressive cumulative stats. Coaches who have benched him for sucking were fired.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Case against Eli Manning getting into the Hall of Fame</h4>
      <p>All stats are from 2004-now (his career), for players with 48+ starts (53 total)
    <ul>
      <li>Eli Manning has never been a first or second team all-pro.</li>
      <li>Eli Manning is 37th in completion percentage, just below Mcnabb and above Fitzpatrick</li>
      <li>Eli Manning is 38th best in Interception-% just above Jameis Winston and Joey Harrington.</li>
      <li>Eli is 32nd in QB rating, just below Joe Flacco.</li>
      <li>Eli is 24th in Adjust Net Yards per Attempt, right above Chad Pennington.</li>
      <li>Eli is 2 games above .500 on his career W/L, at a .512 winning percentage. That is worse than the Phillies this year (for now).</li>
      <li>Eli will be below .500 after this year, unless he gets benched early.</li>
      <li>Eli led the Giants to losing or 8-8 seasons in 2004 (his rookie season, he went 1-6 after Warner went 5-4),
        2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, & 2018).</li>
