  <h3 class="w3-center">A return to normal</h3>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <p>As the calendar transitions to Fall 2020, a sense of (<i>craziness?</i>) normalcy returns. Summer vacations have
      wrapped up (<i>What? I went nowhere.</i>) and children are returning to school (<i>...on their computers</i>). Outside, you can pickup the earthy scent of (<i>California wildfires?</i>) autumn grass,
      a nostalgic reminder of the football practices you once loved (<i>uh...football practices sucked.</i>). And, of course, Sunday afternoons can again be spent watching (<i>the NBA playoffs?</i>) NFL football.  

      <h4 class="w3-center">Around the NFL</h3>
      <p>Tche Eagles got off to a strong 17-0 start before the offensive line opted to peacefully protest by not blocking and allowing Carson Wentz to be violently hit the entire game.  Jason Peters threatened to hold out of the second half
        unless the team rewrote his contract to give him another million dollars.  Zach Ertz dropped a big pass for a first down due to the tears fogging up his vision. Wentz didn't help matters with his own play.  After the game, the Phillies' bullpen
        collectively stated that the Eagles offense will need to improve if the Eagles are going to be a contender this year.</p>

      <p> - The Cowboys and Giants also lost, meaning the Washington Football Teams sits alone atop the NFC East.</p>
      <p> - Bill O'Brien, Head Coach, struggled to prevent Bill O'Brien, General Manager, from looking like an idiot, though it was in a game agaisnt the Super Bowl winning Chiefs.</p>
      <p> - The Browns are the Browns. </p>
      <p> - Gardner Minshew had a great start to his sophmore season, going 19 for 20. Jags are still bad. </p>
      <p> - The Tampa Dream Team didn't look good, but it may have been against the best team in the NFC. </p>
      <p> - Who's excited for Browns-Bengals tonight?</p>
      
    <h3 class="w3-center">Fantasy Week 1</h3>
    <p>
      The Afternoon Delights got off to a fast start with a score of <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/boxscore?leagueId=69673&matchupPeriodId=1&scoringPeriodId=1&seasonId=2020&teamId=15">134.16</a>, enough to win Week 1's $40 High Score prize.
      And their opponent, Farmer Fran, got the 2nd highest score of the week in the loss, which nets them the Bad Beat prize, which had gotten all the way up to a whopping $15.  The Bad Beat is expected to only hit 0-4 times per year, so it's pretty surprising
      that it hit in week 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hulkamaniacs fell to Hall despite Saquon Barkley's lackluster game. The Hulkamaniacs are now the first non-Tommy-owned team to be subject to a $10 Tommy Rule Fine for starting Kenny Golladay, who was ruled OUT for the game.  The fine pool 
      is awared to the team with the most points against at the end of the season (Which was Tommy last year, unfortunately). The Bareback Barback managed to outscore their projected total and still lose by 13 to Team America. Tom Brady played so
      bad that Giselle reviewed their pre-nup, but he still managed 24 points for Barback. But, Russell Wilson dominated Atlanta for Team America, after quietly having an excellent 2019 season that was overshadowed by Lamar Jackson's MVP season. The Morrell
      Streetfighters (Ryan -- I guess name trade negotions fell through) lost to a team that almost didn't show up for the draft.  The Ed Horne Football Team lost a close one to Team Uncle Bill. Both teams appear to be sticking with the names the commisioner 
      put in for their team when inviting them to the league, 2 weeks and 16 years ago, respectively.  The Crackers were the lowest scoring winner in a defeat of the Crusaders. The Crackers finished playing on Sunday and were projected to lose a close one, 
      but the Crusader's 3 Monday players could not get the job done.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reports indicate that the league office is in serious talks to procure a new site for the 2021 fantasy draft. It's potentially the farthest drive for a fantasy draft yet.
