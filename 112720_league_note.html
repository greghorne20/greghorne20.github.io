  <div class="w3-row">
    <p>
        Ed Horne Football Team won the final weekly high score prize, their second of the year. No one hit the bad beat, which means
        that $105 will be put in the winner/runner-up pool. It was a bad week for the Hulkamanaics, who started Drew Brees (OUT), David Johnson (OUT),
        Evan Engran (BYE), and the 49ers (BYE).  (Prater had 0, but played).  The Tommy Rule was put in place to fix an issue with teams not setting their lineups 
        once they were out of playoff contention, and it was effective last year.  The money (which was supposed to be in the range of $0-30) is awarded to the team
        with the most points against. It would be unfair to that team for me to not enforce the Tommy rule, which was passed with a league-wide vote. There haven't been
        any complaints, but since there are so many fines this year I want to make it clear that by enforcing the fines, I'm not being a meter maid giving parking tickets. My non-enforcement of 
        the fines would lead to a team not getting the money they are rightfully owed. Because the rule is clearly not effective, we can consider changes before next season starts. Afternoon Delights wins
        $120 in Tommy fines because of their shitty fantasy defense giving up the most points.

        With the leftover bad beat prize, that leaves the prize pool at $700, to be split 75% to the champion and 25% to the runner up, or $525 and $175 (Teams can agree to alternatives before the championship).

    <h3>Playoff Reminders</h3>
    <p>
        With our 11-week abbreviated season, the playoffs round 1 is held Week 12.  And because the NFL's Week 13 has BYEs, the fantasy championship is Week 14. There are no fantasy games in Week 13. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the limitations of the ESPN fantasy platform, the playoffs have been set up as 2-week rounds as a hacky solution to hold playoffs Week 12 and Week 14. Fantasy points from Weeks 13 and 15 will be manually zeroed out after the fact. 
        What I'm saying is to ignore that the website says this playoff round includes Week 13. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ravens-Steelers</h3>
    <p>
        The Ravens-Steelers game originally scheduled for Thanksgiving has been moved to Tuesday at 8 pm, but could be moved even later. The game will only count for this fantasy week if it is played by Wednedsay December 5. The emergency retroactive substitutions 
        rule will be in effect for this game in case it is changed again (If it's changed again before 11 am on Sunday, I'll send out an update). If a Ravens or Steelers player is starting, teams should have an eligible player on the bench who can fill in case the game is
        canceled late. Team Uncle Bill and the Ed Horne Football Team both have Ravens or Steelers players currently starting.
        Team Uncle Bill currently does not have an elgible backup K for Justin Tucker. Ed Horne Football has an eligible bench defense backing up the Ravens D/ST. Their TE situation is tougher. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>No relief is given if the game is played but a player is ruled out because of injury.</b> That means if Mark Andrews is left in as starter, and the game is played, but Mark
        Andrews is out because of injury, there's no retroactive substitution (but they could pick up a TE from that game since Andrews would be IR-eligible at least 90 min before kickoff).
        Additionally, backup Tyler Higbee is questionable. If he doesn't play, and the Ravens game is cancelled, there's currently no other eligible replacement on the roster, and EFT should consider adding one. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Both of the affected teams have players who can moved to an IR slot, so there's no reason to not pick up an eligible backup.  <a href="2020_Covid19_Amendments.pdf">Read this</a> under <i>Emergency Retroactive Substitutions</i> for the full rules, as 
        determined before the season began.
