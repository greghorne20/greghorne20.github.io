  <h3 class="w3-center">Dak's Garbage Lifts Uncle Bill to the Top</h3>
  <div class="w3-row">
    <p>
        Team Uncle Bill is the lone remaining undefeated team. They took down Barksdale's Waiver Wire on the back of Dak Prescott's 45 point effort.  The Cowboys weren't as lucky, losing 49-38 to the Browns.  Team Uncle Bill even had a 
        0.0 scorer in Calvin Ridley, who had zero catches on five targets, with Julio Jones missing most of the game.  Wire had some good performances from their Vikings players, Dalvin Cook and Adam Thielen, but it wasn't enough.  At the opposite
        end of the leaderboard, the Morrell Street Fighters have yet to win. To make matters worse, they also violated the <b>Tommy Rule</b> by starting an inactive Jared Cook.  And on top of that, they will lose key RB Austin Ekeler for several weeks
        to a hamstring injury.  Their opponent, Farmer Fran, has golfed 3 times this week and hasn't broken 80 once.
    </p>  

    <p>
        The Ed Horne Football Team, as the third lowest scoring team of the week, gets a fortunate win.  Mark Andrews had a strong week, scoring two TDs on three targets.   The Hulkamaniacs look like they'll need some high scoring Saints games to lift their 
        team, led by Alvin Kamara and Drew Brees. This week, another Saint and bench player for the Hulkamaniacs, Latavius Murray, took the bulk of the fantasy production in New Orleans. The Hulkamaniacs could have stolen this game by starting Murray over
        Robert Woods, but it's not a move many would have made.  The Crusaders, decimated by COVID and with a limping Julio Jones, managed to still score over 120. That was too much for Team America, who didn't do much of anything outside of Russel Wilson and 
        Mike Evans. Though Wilson had a strong game, he was outscored by benched QB Aaron Rodgers 37.58 to 24.9.  Bench RB Melvin Gordon also did well with 2 TDS and 100+ yards.  Even a perfect lineup would not have been enough this week, however.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hall and the Crackers fought the tighest game of the week. The Crackers came out on top, 106.5 to 103.72, leaving both teams at 3-1.  The Crackers were led by Odell Bechkam's 3-TD game, which overcame Matt Ryan's poor performance. Hall left some points
        on the bench, at both the WR and RB position. It would have been hard to swap out Tyler Lockett, but the decision to start Devin Singletary over Chris Carson cost Hall the game and is sure to be talked about for months by idiot fans of the team 
        calling into sports radio.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game of the week was between 0-3 Barback and the 1-2 Delights. Barback was led by Tom Brady and George Kittle, who both more than doubled their projections. Barback was the high score of the week, netting them $40. For the Delights, Joe Mixon beat up the 
        Jaguars defense like they were a woman, scoring twice on 151 yards.  The Delights are the second highest scoring team and lost, making them the second <b>Bad Beat</b> winnner.  That's good for $45, and resets the jackpot back to $15 for week 5.
    </p>
        

      <h3 class="w3-center">Around the NFL</h3>
      <p>
          The Titans are at risk of missing yet another week due to COVID. It has been reported that some Titans players continued to practice together at a high school field after their facility was closed. Since players are still testing 
          positive 8-10 days after the facility was closed (when most positives start 3-5 days after transmission), it's very likely some Titans players got the virus at these activities. It would not surprise this commissioner if the Titans
          were forced to forfeit this week's game. The Patriots also have a potential outbreak, but appeared to follow the NFL's protocols.
